# GoFX for CitizenFX

This GoFX project has been automatically generated by the CitizenFX resource template.

It has been altered slightly - please place this repository into a subfolder within your main resource folder. For example:
```dos
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaDoes/gofx X:\cfx-server-data\resources\[local]\gofx\src
```
That way, your source code is still in the resources folder, but the folder structure still allows the resource to be loaded immediately by the server each time you recompile.

To edit the GoFX loader's C# code, open `gofx.sln` in Visual Studio.

To edit the test Go resource's client code, open the `go\src\client` folder.

To edit the test Go resource's server code, open the `go\src\server` folder.

To edit the GoFX loader's C code, open the `go\src\gofx` folder.

To build GoFX and the test Go resource, run `build.cmd`.

Afterwards, you can use `ensure gofx` in your server.cfg to start the resource automatically each time the server starts. If your server is already started, you can use `start gofx` to start the resource manually.
